# Contributing to Otterize projects

A big welcome and thank you for considering contributing to Otterize open source projects! Itâ€™s people like you that make this corner of the world better for the entire community.

Reading and following these guidelines will help us make the contribution process easy and effective for everyone involved. 

## Quicklinks

* [Getting started](#getting-started)
* [GitHub issues](#github-issues)
* [Pull requests](#pull-requests)
* [Getting help](#getting-help)

## Getting Started

Contributions are made to this repo via GitHub issues and pull requests (PRs). A few general guidelines that cover both:

- Search for existing issues and PRs before creating your own.
- We work hard to makes sure issues are handled in a timely manner but, depending on the impact, it could take a while to investigate the root cause. A friendly ping in the comment thread to the submitter or a contributor can help draw attention if your issue is blocking you.

### GitHub issues

GitHub issues should be used to report problems with the code, request a new feature, or discuss potential changes before a PR is created. When you create a new issue, a template will be loaded that will guide you through collecting and providing the information we need to investigate.

If you find an existing GitHub issue that addresses the problem you're having, please add your own reproduction information to the existing issue rather than creating a new one. Adding a [reaction](https://github.blog/2016-03-10-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments/) can also help by indicating to our maintainers that a particular problem is affecting more than just the reporter.

### Pull Requests

PRs to our code are always welcome and can be a quick way to get your fix or improvement slated for an upcoming release. In general, PRs should:

- Only fix/add the functionality in question **or** address wide-spread whitespace/style issues, not both.
- Add unit or integration tests for fixed or changed functionality (if a test suite already exists).
- Address a single concern.
- Include documentation in the repo or on our [docs site](https://docs.otterize.com).
- Be accompanied by a complete Pull Request template (loaded automatically when a PR is created).

For changes that address core functionality or would require breaking changes (i.e. would indicate a major release), it's best to open an issue to discuss your proposal first. This is not required but can save time creating and reviewing changes.

In general, we follow the ["fork-and-pull" Git workflow](https://github.com/susam/gitpr)

1. Fork the repository to your own GitHub account
2. Clone the project to your machine
3. Create a branch locally with a succinct but descriptive name
4. Commit changes to the branch
5. Follow any formatting and testing guidelines specific to this repo
6. Push changes to your fork
7. Open a PR in our repository and follow the PR template so that we can efficiently review the changes.
