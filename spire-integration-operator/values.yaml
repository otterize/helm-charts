  # resources, such as Minikube. If you do want to specify resources, uncomment the following
  # lines, adjust them as necessary, and remove the curly braces after 'resources:'.

# allowGetAllResources gives get permission to watch on all resources. If disabled, the operator will only
# be able to resolve pods up to their built-in owners. For example, a Pod is owned by a ReplicaSet that is owned by a Deployment.
# If that Deployment is owned by a custom resource, the operator will not be able to resolve it.
# For this resolving to be successful, the operator needs to be able to `get` all resources.
